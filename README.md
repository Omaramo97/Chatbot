# Chatbot

Allows for communication between Computer and User. Chatbot interprets and process the User input and depending on what they typed will give a scripted response

## Features

If you write "hello","howdy" or "dog" the Chatbot will give you a response.
For the dog response, a different picture will follow up every time the dog keyword is found.

## Why choose the Chatbot?

I chose to work on the Chatbot just so I can see how it runs at the most basic level. Customizable and informative, depending on the environment the virtual assistant is great at handling simple tasks
